## 📅 Weekly Notes

  

### Week 2: CLI Intro/work

📌 **Important Takeaways:**

- I never knew cd would take you back to your home folder, nugget of gold...
- I learned some far more effecient ways of removing and dealing with folders while working inside them, etc.
- I finally had a valid reason to spend time learning about Google cloud and spinning up a VM in the GCLOUD!

### Week 3: Nano, Git, GitHub, Markdown

📌 **Important Takeaways:**

- Spent hours finally focusing on using MARKDOWN, which I used to hate. It's really like VI, once you learn it, it's quick and not scary at all! This repo is an example!

- Git aliases are helpful, I was always too lazy to create any bash/zsh aliases for GIT but now I've done so, and it's helpful.
